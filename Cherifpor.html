            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am Cherif Alwaly Fall, a dedicated and passionate individual who believes in the power of resilience, adaptability, and continuous growth. As a proud graduate of Washburn University in Kansas, where I was a member of the Men's Basketball Team and earned my degree in Business Management, my journey is a reflection of the values and experiences that have shaped me into who I am today. Born and raised in Senegal, West Africa, I embarked on a life-changing adventure in 2012 when I received a scholarship to attend Lee Academy in Maine. This pivotal moment marked the beginning of a transformative chapter in my life, as I courageously stepped out of my comfort zone, leaving behind the familiar sights and sounds of home to embrace a world filled with new challenges and opportunities.
                Navigating this unfamiliar territory, I discovered the true essence of resilience and adaptability. With the unwavering support of my teammates and classmates, I learned the importance of teamwork and collaboration, values that have remained at the core of my personal and professional journey. My academic and athletic pursuits led me to Cloud County Community College in Kansas, where I majored in Business Administration and played an integral role on the Men's Basketball Team. These formative years were instrumental in honing my leadership skills, fostering my passion for personal growth, and deepening my commitment to excellence both on and off the court.
